# Hyderabad Real Estate Market Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the real estate market in Hyderabad, India. The goal is to extract, clean, and analyze property listings to uncover key trends, pricing patterns, and insights into the local market. The entire process, from data collection to final analysis, is documented in a series of Jupyter notebooks.

## Project Workflow

The project is broken down into a clear, sequential workflow, with each notebook handling a specific part of the process:

*   **`01_Initial-Webscraping-EDA-project1.ipynb`**: This notebook contains the Python script used to scrape property data from the `housing.com` website. It gathers raw data on property names, locations, prices, sizes, and more, saving the output to a raw CSV file.

*   **`02_DataWrangling-and-Cleaning-EDA-Project1.ipynb`**: Focuses on data cleaning and preprocessing. This step involves handling missing values, correcting data types, and transforming columns (like `Price` and `Size`) into a usable format for analysis.

*   **`03_Visualizations-EDA-Project1.ipynb`**: This notebook is dedicated to data visualization. It uses libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create charts and plots that help in understanding property distributions, price variations across locations, and relationships between different features.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Data Collection**: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`
- **Data Manipulation and Analysis**: `pandas`, `numpy`
- **Data Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Environment**: `Jupyter Notebook`

    ## Key Insights from the Analysis

This analysis of the Hyderabad real estate market revealed several key trends and patterns:

*   **Price Distribution:** The majority of properties listed are concentrated in the mid-range price bracket. A detailed histogram shows a right-skewed distribution, indicating that high-value luxury properties are less common than more affordable options.
  
*   **Property Type Popularity:** **Flats/Apartments** are the most common type of property listed for sale, significantly outnumbering independent houses and villas. This suggests a high demand for community-based living.

*   **Construction Status:** The data shows a significant number of properties are currently **Under Construction**, with delivery dates spanning the next 2-5 years. This points to a rapidly growing and developing real estate market.

*   **Developer vs. Seller Listings:** The majority of listings are posted by **[Your Finding, e.g., Developers or individual Sellers]**, which provides insight into whether the market is dominated by primary sales or resale properties.
